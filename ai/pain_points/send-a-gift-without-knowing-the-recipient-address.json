The recipient may have recently moved, or the sender may have lost touch with them. This problem occurs frequently, and potential customers would be willing to pay a premium for a solution that solves their dilemma. |\n| Lack of Expertise to DIY Home Repairs | Many homeowners lack the expertise needed to undertake DIY home repairs. This can lead to frustration and disappointment when they attempt to fix something and end up making the problem worse. With few affordable resources available, people would be open to a service that offered easy-to-follow guidance and step-by-step tutorials on DIY home repairs.|\n| Inadequate Help with Elderly Care | People with elderly loved ones often struggle to provide a quality life for them. They may not have enough knowledge or resources to manage their care effectively.

This is a persistent problem that many people face, which leads to wasting their valuable time looking for a spot while increasing the risk of car theft, and damage. A solution that provides a reliable and secure parking space locator service will be beneficial to these drivers. |\n| Complexity of Finding a Public Restroom | People who are traveling, working, or just out and about often find it challenging to locate a safe and clean public restroom quickly. This can result in discomfort and can impact normal daily activities. An app or service that provides locations of nearby public restrooms and rates them based on their cleanliness and accessibility would be helpful. |\n| Inconsistent Quality of Online Product Reviews | Concerns over the reliability and authenticity of online product reviews are growing, leading to increased skepticism among consumers. This leaves consumers with uncertainty and apprehension when shopping online, and they may forgo purchases altogether, eventually hurting e-commerce as a whole. A solution that utilizes a personalized, trustworthy review system or partnering with verified reviewers or experts, can help boost consumers' confidence in online reviews. |\n| Difficulty in Scheduling Freelance Services | Scheduling a service appointment with a freelancer, such as a handyman or house cleaner, can be frustrating and time-consuming.

A service that provides affordable online tutoring with real-time, personalized attention could be invaluable to parents and students alike. |\n| Ineffective Event Planning System | Event planning can be challenging for individuals who don't have extensive experience with planning or coordinating events. Poor planning can lead to confusion, last-minute stress, and unsatisfied attendees.
