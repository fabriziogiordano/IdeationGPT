  "content": "| Short Description | Long Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Medication Adherence | Many individuals struggle with taking their medications on time, in the proper dosage, and/or consistently. Failure to adhere to medication regimens can have severe negative consequences on individual health, leading to increased hospitalizations, higher medical costs, and even death in some cases. Helping these individuals set up reminder systems or providing education on the importance of medication adherence can not only improve the quality of their lives but also be a profitable business opportunity. |\n| Medication Side Effects | Certain medications can cause uncomfortable or harmful side effects, leading individuals to stop taking their medication altogether. A one-person business that provides resources and support for individuals dealing with medication side effects such as herbal remedies or symptom management strategies can be both relevant and profitable. |\n| Drug Interactions | With the rise of polypharmacy (taking multiple medications at once), drug interactions are becoming increasingly common. There is a need for services that provide assistance in identifying potentially harmful drug interactions and helping individuals manage their medications safely. |\n| Prescription Cost | The soaring cost of prescription medications leaves many individuals unable to afford their medication, leading to dangerous gaps in treatment. A one-person business that helps individuals navigate options for prescription assistance, discount programs, or alternative therapies can be a profitable solution to this ongoing issue. |\n| Dislike of Medication Format | Individuals sometimes dislike the format in which medication is provided such as taste, texture, or size. Offering alternative forms of medication delivery such as chewable tablets, capsules, or liquid options, can provide individuals with a better experience and create a profitable market. |\n| Need for Medication Administration Assistance | Individuals with disabilities, elderly adults, or those with complex medication regimens often struggle to manage their medications independently. A business that provides medication administration assistance could be a profitable solution to this ongoing issue. |\n| Low Health Literacy | A lack of understanding of medication instructions or health information can hinder an individual's ability to manage their medications properly. Supporting individuals with low health literacy in understanding medication regimens, side effects, or instructions can improve adherence and reduce negative consequences. |\n| Need for Personalization | Individuals have different needs and preferences. A business that offers medication customization and personalization to each individual's unique needs could create a niche market with a loyal customer base. |\n| Remote Access to Pharmacy Services | With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have become increasingly interested in telehealth and online support services for medication management. A business that offers safe and reliable remote access to pharmacy services through digital platforms can be a profitable solution to this growing need. |\n| Medication Waste | Unused or expired medication can be harmful to individuals or the environment. A business that safely and sustainably disposes of unused medications could be a solution to this issue while also generating revenue. |",
