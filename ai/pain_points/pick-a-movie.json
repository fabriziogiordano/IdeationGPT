  "content": "Sure! Here are 10 potential pain points for an audience interested in movies:\n\n| Short | Long |\n| ----- | ---- |\n| Difficulty finding indie/foreign movies | The person has a taste for movies outside of Hollywood, but has trouble finding the more obscure films. They may have to rely on limited theaters, small DVD collections, or online streaming services with limited selection. |\n| Confusion around streaming service options | With so many different streaming services now available (Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Disney+, etc.), the person is unsure which ones to subscribe to for the movies they want to watch. They may end up paying for multiple services, or missing out on certain movies altogether. |\n| Difficulty finding new recommendations | The person has a hard time discovering new movies to watch that align with their interests. They may feel like they've exhausted all the options available to them in a certain genre or style. |\n| High ticket prices at theaters | The person enjoys watching movies on the big screen, but finds the cost of tickets too expensive. They may only be able to afford to see movies infrequently or at off-peak times. |\n| Limited options for physically disabled individuals | The person has difficulty accessing movie theaters or home screening options due to physical disabilities. They may need specific accommodations (such as closed captions or audio descriptions) that are not available or difficult to access. |\n| Nostalgia for older movies | The person has a deep appreciation for classic movies, but finds it difficult to access them through modern channels. They may need to rely on DVD collections, home streaming services, or even VHS tapes to watch their favorite older films. |\n| Lack of diversity in Hollywood movies | The person has a desire to watch movies that represent a wider range of cultures, ethnicities, or identities, but feels Hollywood movies often fall short in this regard. They may have to seek out independent or foreign films to find more diverse perspectives. |\n| Frustration with movie spoilers | The person hates having major plot points or twists ruined for them, but finds it difficult to avoid spoilers in the age of social media. They may have to limit their online activity or seek out movies as soon as they are released in theaters to avoid learning key information beforehand. |\n| Desire for a communal movie-watching experience | The person misses the experience of watching movies with friends or in a theater full of people, but may not have access to a physical group or feel uncomfortable attending theaters in person. They may need to seek out virtual watch parties or online forums to replicate the feeling of watching movies with others. |\n| Difficulty with finding time to watch movies | The person has a long to-do list or a busy schedule, which makes finding time to watch movies difficult. They may only be able to watch movies infrequently or in small chunks. |",
