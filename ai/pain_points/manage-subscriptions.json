People often forget they're subscribed to services they no longer need or use, causing them to overspend on unnecessary monthly charges. This leads to cluttered credit card payments, often resulting in overdrawn bank accounts and fees. |\n| Lack of subscription cancellation knowledge | People often do not know how to cancel subscriptions effectively. Cancellation processes are often complicated and hidden behind paywalls, resulting in people continuing to pay for the service long after they've stopped using it. The frustration of trying to cancel a subscription without success can generate negative emotions and resentment towards the service provider. |\n| Automated subscription cancellations | An automated subscription cancellation service could help people manage their subscriptions more effectively. This service would identify subscriptions that someone might not be using and confirm they want to cancel them before doing so. This would reduce the overcharges and multiple cancellations attempts. |\n| Subscription consolidation | Many people subscribe to several services in order to fulfill specific needs such as streaming, music, television, and learning. Consolidating these subscriptions into a one-stop-shop platform could save people money, time, and energy. |\n| Subscription monitoring | A subscription monitoring service could help people keep track of which subscriptions they have signed up for, which are being underused, and which are redundant. This service could provide tailored recommendations on which subscriptions to keep and which to cancel, thus saving people time and money. |\n| Subscription negotiation | Subscription providers are often willing to negotiate the price to keep their customers. However, negotiating one's subscriptions can be a daunting and frustrating task for most people. A subscription negotiation service that takes care of this process, saves people money and reduces negotiation anxiety. |\n| Personalised recommendations on subscriptions | People often lack understanding of the subscription market and the available options that can cater to their specific needs. A personalised subscription recommendation service can help find and sow down the perfect subscription offerings based on an individual's interests, hobbies, and requirements. |\n| Subscription usage reports | People often don't know how much they are spending on subscriptions each month, which can lead to overspending. A subscription usage report service would track a person's total subscription cost per month and present this data in an easy, digestible format that helps the person understand how much they're spending and on what. |\n| Subscription protection | Many subscription providers offer trial periods or promotional discounts as a tactic to acquire new customers. Often, once the promotional period ends, the price will rise without the customer being aware. A subscription protection service can help prevent people from falling into such traps, thus saving them money, by tracking both trial periods, and the regular subscription cost, and alerting them before rates automatically increases. |\n| Subscription-based expense management | For businesses, tracking subscription expenses and approvals can be a challenging task. A subscription expense management tool could help automate the finance process and provide transparency for all relevant stakeholders. This could streamline business operations, saving time and money, and improving efficiency. |",
