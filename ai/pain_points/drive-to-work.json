  "content": "| Short Description | Long Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Time-crunched commuters | Commuters face long, stressful work commutes that can take up a significant amount of time every day. This leaves them little time to engage in activities that are important to them like working out, spending time with family, or pursuing hobbies. |\n| Lack of convenient and healthy breakfast options | Many commuters find themselves skipping breakfast altogether or grabbing unhealthy fast food options due to a lack of time and convenience. This can lead to negative health consequences in the long run. |\n| High gas prices | Commuters who drive their own cars to work have to deal with high gas prices that eat into their overall budget. This can be especially hard for those with fixed incomes. |\n| Poor road infrastructure | Poor road infrastructure including potholes, traffic jams, and confusing highways can make commuting a frustrating and dangerous experience. |\n| Lack of carpooling options | Many commuters would like to carpool with others to save time and money but struggle to find trustworthy carpool partners. |\n| Loss of productivity | Commuting can lead to a significant loss of productivity, making it hard for workers to stay focused and energized throughout the day. |\n| Need for remote work options | The pandemic has highlighted the importance of remote work options for many people. Commuters who have long, inconvenient, and expensive commutes often need the flexibility to work from home some days to maintain their productivity and mental health. |\n| Inefficient public transportation system | Public transportation options that are unreliable, not frequent, or not available in certain areas can make commuting more difficult and expensive. |\n| Lack of safe bike lanes | Some commuters may prefer to bike to work as a healthy and eco-friendly alternative but struggle to find safe bike lanes. |\n| Stress and anxiety from traffic | Commuters often report feeling stressed and anxious from sitting in traffic, especially during rush hour. This can lead to negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being. |",
