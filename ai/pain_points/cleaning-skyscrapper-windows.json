  "content": "| Short | Long |\n| ----- | ---- |\n| Difficulty reaching certain areas | Cleaning the exterior of a high-rise building requires specialized equipment and expertise that many window cleaning companies lack. As a result, some areas of the building may not be cleaned well or at all due to being hard to reach. |\n| Weather disruptions | Outdoor window cleaning is heavily reliant on favorable weather conditions, and bad weather can cause delays and cancellations that can impact the cleaning schedule and profitability. |\n| Safety concerns | Window cleaning at high altitude poses many risks to workers, and accidents can be fatal. Therefore, customers are more inclined to hire companies with impeccable safety records and experienced staff that are certified in working at heights. |\n| Damage to the building exterior | Inexperienced or careless window cleaners can inadvertently cause damage to the building fa√ßade, which can be costly to repair and may result in legal liability. |\n| Limited water access | Many high-rise buildings are in urban areas with limited water access, and that can pose a challenge for window cleaning companies that rely on water for cleaning. Figuring out a way to efficiently transport and store enough water for the job can be difficult. |\n| Time constraints | High-rise building owners and property managers need to have their windows cleaned regularly to maintain the building's appearance, but scheduled cleaning times can be interrupted by other maintenance requirements, construction, and property management priorities. |\n| Building access limitations | Some buildings have unique designs or other architectural elements that require specialized equipment or techniques to gain access for cleaning. These situations can lead to increased costs and more project time. |\n| High competition | There are numerous window cleaning companies that operate in urban cities, and the competition can be intense. Differentiating from competitors can be a challenge, and price undercutting to win business is common. |\n| Environmental concerns | Some high-rise building owners are seeking out more eco-friendly cleaning services. Companies that can offer organic, non-toxic and biodegradable cleaning materials would get an advantage over traditional window cleaning services. |\n| Limited communication with customers | High-rise window cleaning services often involve complex logistics, and communicating with customers about unexpected changes or delays can be difficult. Having a customer support team that can quickly manage customer service requests and address any issues can be challenging for companies. |",
